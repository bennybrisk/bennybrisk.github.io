        <p>I think coding is really cool and cyber security interests me, learning code is just like learning a new language fun!<br> 
            and this website has its own language behind it there is a code that makes everything happen, everything expands <br>
        and has more to it than meets the eye, everything can be expanded to a different perspective, and that is code in a jist.</p>
